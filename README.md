# Ransomware Incident Response Journal

## Overview
This project documents a hypothetical ransomware incident at a small healthcare clinic. The journal entry follows a structured incident handler's template and includes a detailed analysis of the attack.

## Scenario Details
A ransomware attack disrupted business operations at a healthcare clinic after a phishing email containing a malicious attachment was opened. This journal entry outlines the incident's timeline, root cause, and next steps for remediation.

## Journal Entry

### Date
December 30, 2024

### Entry

### Description
Documenting a ransomware attack on a small U.S. healthcare clinic that disrupted operations and encrypted critical patient data.

### Tools Used
- None initially (to be updated after forensic analysis or incident response begins).

### The 5 W's

- **Who caused the incident?**  
An organized group of unethical hackers targeting healthcare and transportation sectors.

- **What happened?**  
The attackers gained network access via a phishing email containing a malicious attachment. This installed malware that deployed ransomware, encrypting the clinic's files and displaying a ransom note.

- **When did the incident occur?**  
Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m.

- **Where did the incident happen?**  
A small U.S. healthcare clinic specializing in primary care.

- **Why did the incident happen?**  
The clinic fell victim to targeted phishing emails, leading to the execution of ransomware after an employee downloaded a malicious attachment.

### Additional Notes
- Immediate action is required to isolate infected systems and prevent further damage.
- Consider implementing employee cybersecurity awareness training to mitigate future phishing attempts.
- Investigate the use of anti-phishing tools and endpoint protection to detect and block malicious emails and attachments.
- Explore the feasibility of recovering encrypted files through backups before considering communication with the attackers.

## Key Learnings
- Importance of phishing awareness training.
- Need for robust endpoint protection.
- Value of regular and secure backups to mitigate ransomware risks.

## How to Use
This project serves as a reference for documenting and handling ransomware incidents. Adapt the journal entry template for your own cybersecurity incident documentation needs.
